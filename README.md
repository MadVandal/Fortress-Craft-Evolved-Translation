# Fortress-Craft-Evolved-Translation
This is a translation project for the game FortressCraft Evolved made to its goal to manage all active translations in one project and in one system.
At the moment we get the master-language-file from the developer and change it manualy to a valid Android-xml-translation format.
The handbook language-files are generated with the tool [fcHelper](https://github.com/Fjolnir-Dvorak/fcHelper).

For translation we are using a platform called [weblate](https://github.com/WeblateOrg/weblate), which is hosted privately.
To join the translation please contact us at [Discord FortressCraft#translation](https://discord.gg/EHbmn5r).
