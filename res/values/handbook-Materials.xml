You can place the extractor up against an ore block and it will consume energy to extract resources automatically. You can open the ore extractor control panel by pressing the &apos;Interact&apos; key (default &apos;E&apos;). This allows you to add energy to the machine from your suit, collect ore from its internal storage, and upgrade the machine. The starting extractors are significantly more resource efficient than super digging and can be left unattended.</string>
<string name="MA.Extractor.03.Paragraph">The extractor has an internal storage capacity of 500 energy which is a little over two full suit&apos;s worth of energy so you will need to make multiple trips to fill it up. If its internal storage fills up the extractor will cease mining until it has been emptied. You can place a storage hopper next to the extractor to provide more storage space and also return the ore to you base using conveyors.</string>

<string name="MA.Extractor.07.Header">Motor</string>

<string name="MA.Extractor.10.Paragraph">Upgrading the cutter head increases the efficiency at which the excavator extracts ores. This means that it will be able to retrieve more ore from a vein over its lifetime. Besides the efficiency upgrade, the new cutter head will also allow the excavator to dig harder materials, which the base cutter head may not be able to cut into at all.</string>

The Geothermal works by generating energy from heat differences, for every pipe placed below the cold cavern level the power generated per second will increase.

Connecting a controller to a vat is as simple as placing the controller anywhere directly against the vat. If connected, the popup window will display this, and the controller will orient itself towards the vat and extend pipes to connect to it. 

A refinery can process only one product at a time: You can cycle through the different recipes by pressing ‘e’ while having the controller selected. It can only start producing a new result until the internal storage can accommodate it; if a different product is still in there, production cannot continue.

You can retrieve products from the controller by pressing ‘q’, or by connecting a storage hopper.</string>

<string name="MA.Refinery_Reactor_Vat.02.Paragraph">A refinery reactor vat is a large structure built from Reactor Vat Component blocks. When placed in a solid 3 by 3 by 3 configuration, the vat will display as a large machine.

The reactor vat contains the chemical processes required to recombine carbohydrates. In order to function, it must be connected to a controller. It is possible to stack vats on top of each one connected to controller, in order to allow the controller to operate on multiple vats at the same time. This will give you a linear increase in production and power cost, as well as storage of output product: Each vat can store 10 completed products before it will run out of room to process more. The bonus in using more vats on one controller is to avoid having to make multiple expensive refinery controllers.

Each vat contains many electrical conduits as well as many transport pipes. Because of this, any power supplied to the vats will also be delivered to the connected controller. Maximum power storage of the refinery depends on the amount of vats connected.</string>
